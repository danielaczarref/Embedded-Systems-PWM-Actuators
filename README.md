# Embedded-Systems-PWM-Actuators

1. Create a circuit to control the direction of rotation of a DC motor using an H bridge, to drive the motor by an external power source (battery). Display the direction of rotation using two LEDs (Ex: red for one direction, green for another).

2. Create a circuit to control the rotation speed of a DC motor using PWM signal. Use a transistor to drive the motor from an external power source (battery). Implement the duty cycle variation using a potentiometer.

3. Implement a Soft PWM (PWM via software without using PWM ports) to act on a ServoMotor by setting angles every 10 degrees, ranging from 10ยบ to 170ยบ.
